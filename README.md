# Optimization Methods Project

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of several optimization methods, including the Nelder-Mead method, along with a variety of tests for 2D and 3D problems. This project was developed as part of an academic group project for the 2019-2020 academic year.

## Problem and Approach

Our procedure proposes a solution for achieving an electric field generated through:

- **Inverse Crime**: The goal is to verify testing by evaluating the functionality and efficiency of the algorithm.
- **Constant Function**: Obtained by averaging the values of the function generated by the inverse crime method.
- **Quadratic Function**: Generated as \( KX^2 \).

For each case, several tests were performed until the objective was achieved. Finally, by evaluating the obtained results, we observed that in the case of the electric field generated using the inverse crime method, the error percentage was lower compared to those obtained using the constant function and the quadratic function.

## Project Structure

### Code
The core MATLAB files are located in the `script` directory and include functions and test cases for optimization tasks:
- **NelderMeadMethod.m**: Implementation of the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm.
- **Etot.m**, **Etotx.m**, **Etoty.m**: Functions related to the total energy computation.
- **Exy.m**: Function to compute energy between points in 2D space.
- **Test files**: Located in subfolders such as `crimine_inverso/test2D/` and `crimine_inverso/test3D/`, these files contain various test cases for both 2D and 3D optimization problems.

### Documentation
The project is supported by the following documentation files:
- **Presentation**: `Gruppo_4_aa2019-2020.pptx` (located in `assets/`) - A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project and its goals.
